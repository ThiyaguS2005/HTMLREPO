        Over the centuries, the Japanese have forged a spiritual bond with the mountain. Legend has it that notable religious ascetic Hasegawa Kakugyo (1541â€“1646) summited the mountain over 100 times. His feats led to the formation of Fuji-ko, a group of likeminded Mt. Fuji worshippers. The sect built shrines, created rock monuments, and fasted to show their dedication. Their fanaticism eventually led the Tokugawa Shogunate to ban the religion, but despite this, Japan's long-standing tradition of mountain worship has ensured the mountain remains revered and respected as a site of spiritual importance.
